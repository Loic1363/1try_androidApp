# Android APP

This project represents my journey into mobile app development using Flutter and Dart. As someone new to this technology stack, I am exploring the basics and gradually building my confidence by creating this app from scratch.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application designed to help me learn and get familiar with Flutter widgets, Dart language, and app development workflows.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
